Encapsulation in Java:
    Encapsulation is hiding the class variables by making them private and providing
    getter setter methods.
Benefits:
    Better control over the data and security.
Collections Framework:
Collections framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which have many
methods to store and manipulate the data.
String name;
String name1;
String name2;
String [] names = new String [10];
Limitations of the array
    1) Arrays are fixed in size once we have created an array we can't modify it's size
    2) Arrays don't have built in methods.
Collections
    1) Dynamic.
    2) They have built in methods to manipulate the data
    3) Collections framework does not work with the primitive data types.
        we have to use the wrapper classes.
    4) When we convert the primitive data type to non-primitive we call it boxing
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
Boxing:
    int num=10;
    Integer wrapper=new Integer(num); // boxing - longer way
AutoBoxing:
    Integer wrapper=num;

Double d=new Double(25.5);
double num4=d.doubleValue(); //un-boxing
double num5=d; // auto un-boxing



ArrayList and LinkedList adjust dynamically, so they don't waste space!!!!!

What is equals method why we need to override it? Interview Question
to tell java how to check if two objects are equal

In java, we are always inheriting in more than one class
================================================================================
In java when we make a class inherit from another class we are already doing multiple
inheritance because Object class is automatically inherited for all the classes.
