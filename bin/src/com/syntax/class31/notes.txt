Maps in Java:

It's a data structure that allows us to store key value pairs.
1) searching is efficient.
2) we can use any types of keys like Double String char etc, we are not restricted to
integer based natural indexes.
There are many types of maps but, we will be discussing only four of them
1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap 4) HashTable(Old one)
HashMap:
    1) HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data.
    2) insertion order is not maintained.
    3) most widely used map.
LinkedHashMap:
    LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order.
    insertion speed is same as HashMap.
    Retrieval is the slowest one.
TreeMap:
    data is sorted on the natural order.
    insertion is slowest because of the sorting.
HashTable:
    is a thread safe data means it can handle multiple insertions and retrievals at the same time
    from multiple CPU cores but because of thread safety feature it is also very slow
    so if you are sure that you will never write multithreading code you will never use it.
