Super keyword:
super keyword like "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object.We can use the super
keyword in 3 different ways.
1) To access the super class variables if we have same named variables in super classes
and base class.
2) if we have same method names in parent and child class we can use the super keyword
to access the parent class method otherwise by default java refers to the child class methods.
3) As constructors don't participate in inheritance we can use super() to call the constructors
from the parent class.
Rules:
1) If we have a constructor in the parent class that takes two arguments we must have a constructor
inside the child class that at least takes those two arguments.
2) we can't use this() and super() inside the same constructor.
3)super can't be used in static methods

Method overloading in java:
If we have same named methods in a class with a different number of parameters or different
sequence of parameters or different data types of the parameters it is called method overloading.
