Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are keywords in java that defines from where a certain variable, method
class or a constructor can be accessed.
There are 4 types of access in java that we can define using three keywords:
1) private  2) protected  3) public
Types of access are 4:
1) private 2) default (applied when no keyword is used) 3) protected 4) public

Private access (keyword is private):

when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes
these can only be accessed within that class.

Default access:

Applied when we don't use any keyword

when we don't use any of the keywords default access is applied by java to
those variables methods or classes etc. which means these things can only be
accessed from the same package

Protected access:

we use protected class
when protected access is applied class members(variables methods etc.) can be
accessed from other packages but only in the classes that participate in
inheritance.

Public access:

public means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project
