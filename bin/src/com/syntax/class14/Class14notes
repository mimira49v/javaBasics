Methods:
A block of code or set of instructions that are executed when we call a method.
two main types of methods
predefined(built-in) and user defined
predefined methods are the methods by java guys they are part of JDK
like nextInt method
user defined methods are the methods that are created by us.(user)
class Methods{
int addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2){
System.out.println(num1, num2);
return num1+num2;
}
}
Steps to define a method:
    1) return type:
    for example int is a void type that means this method does not return
    any data it can just execute some logic or can print smh on console.
    other examples of written type are int String double etc basically we can
    return all data types from a method even the objects and arrays.
    2) method name:
    addTwoNumber is the method name in above example
    3)Method Header:
    int addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2) is called method header
    4) addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2) is called method signature
    5) (int num1,int num2) is called a prametar list the inputs to the method
    all the datatypes that we can return from a method we can also take that as input
    in the form of parameters
    6) {
    System.out.println(num1+num2);
    }
    is called the method body that contains the logic that is executed when we call a method
    7) Syntax to call a method
    Methods obj=new Methods();
    obj.addTwoNumber(10,12); must pass values inside the brackets!
    8) return is the keyword that we use to return the data from a method in
    above example we are not returning anything
