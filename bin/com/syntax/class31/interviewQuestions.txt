Scenario: in our bank we are giving our costumers a 29.9% APR
	- we are running a promotion for this month only for 19.9%

Let's create a game where we roll a die, and move a player around a game board.
The board has 40 spaces, arranged in a circle

The player starts at position 0.  Loop 30 times.  Each time through the loop, do this:
- roll the die (each die has a random value, 1-6)
- print player start position, die value, and ending position

sample output:

start=0, roll=3, end=3
start=3, roll=2, end=5
start=38, roll=6, end=4
