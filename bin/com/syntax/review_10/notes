Inheritance in Java:
    This is a mechanism in java through which one class can acquire the properties
    and methods from another class.The class from which we acquire the properties is
    called parent/superclass/baseclass and the class which acquire these properties and methods
    is called Child class/derived class/subclass
Advantages:
    Code duplication is reduced
    Saves Memory
    execution time is less
Disadvantages:
    Classes get tightly coupled if we change something in the parent class it will affect all  the
    children classes and we have to make sure that this new change is compatible with the code that
    we have in the children classes.
When we should use inheritance:
    If there is a case which we would have to use the same methods in many classes the best practice
    would be to create a parent class and use it to extend the methods into the subclasses.
Types of Inheritance:
    we have 4 types of inheritance 1) single 2) hierarchical 3) multilevel 4) multiple
Single Inheritance:
In Single inheritance we have one only one parent and only one child class

Class Animal{

String name;
String color;
int age;
double weight;

}

class Dog extends Animal{
}

Hierarchical inheritance:
In Hierarchical we have only one parent class and multiple children classes.
For example the Object class in Jdk.

Class Animal{

String name;
String color;
int age;
double weight;

}

class Dog extends Animal{
}
class Cat extends Animal{
}

Multilevel inheritance:
If we have one parent and one child class and many intermediate classes it is called multilevel inheritance:

class Human{
String name;
}
Employee extends Human{
String employeeId;
}
class Teacher extends Employee{
String subjects;
}

Multiple inheritance:
in multiple inheritance we have a single child class and multiple parent classes.


THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED IN JAVA BUT POSSIBLE WITH THE HELP OF INTERFACES
class Display{
int resolution;
}
class Keyboard{
int noOfKeys;
}
class Laptop extends Display,Keyboard{
}
Rules:
    1) Private members are not inherited (private fields and private methods)
    2) Constructors don't participate in inheritance
    3) if we have constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor in the children classes as well
    4) in java subclass can only extend single parent class
