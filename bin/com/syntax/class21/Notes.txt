Inheritance in java:    (INTERVIEW ANSWER)
It's a mechanism in java through which a child class gets the properties and methods from a parent class.
Benefits:
    1) saves time to code
    2) code duplication is reduced
    3) execution time is faster
Disadvantages:
    Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.
Types of inheritance:
There are 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them:
    1) single
    2)Hierarchical
    3)Multilevel(not supported in java)
Single inheritance:
    in single inheritance we have only one child and one parent class.Or only two classes
    participate in inheritance one as child one as parent.

class parent{

}
class Child  extends Parent{
}
Hierarchical:
     In Hierarchical inheritance we have a single parent class and multiple child classes

class Parent{
}
class Child1 extends Parent{
}
class Child2 extends Parent{
}
Multilevel:
we have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have a classes ABC
class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A.
Class A{
}
Class B extend A{
}
Class C extend B{
}

super keyword:
Super keyword is like the "this" it refers to the parent class object. For example, we can access
the fields methods or constructors of parent class inside the child class using this keyword.
