Method overriding in java:
    Method overriding happens when we have same named methods in parent and child classes.
Benefits of method overriding:
    1) Flexibility = if we don't like something from the parent class we can override it.
       and can provide our own implementation.
    2) Same method can act differently depending upon the object on which we call it.
Rules:
    1) Without inheritance method overriding is not possible.
    2) method signature should be same in parent class and in child class.(dynamic binding)
    3) if something does not participate in inheritance we can't override it like
    constructors and private methods.
    4) we can increase the visibility in the child classes, but we can't decrease it
    for example we can go from default or protected to public, but we can't do the reverse.
    5) we can't override a static method, but we can redeclare it.For example main
    method can't be overridden as it is static.
    6) We can't have different return type in the child class it must be same as of parent class.
// final means last class or method can't override it
//       same goes for a variables as well

OOPS Main pillars:
1) Inheritance(code re-usability)
2) Polymorphism (less code dynamic code)
3) Abstraction ()
4) Encapsulation

// Abstract class abstract methods
