Maps in Java:
    Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs.
Benefits:
    1) We can store two values inside the maps
    2) Searching is very efficient in maps
Types of maps:
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap
HashMap:
    1) Insertion order is not maintained (downside)
    2) Insertion and retrieval is fastest (upside)
LinkedHashMap:
    1) maintains the insertion order
    2) insertion speed is same as HashMap but retrieval speed is slowest
TreeMap:
    1) Data is sorted in natural order by default
    2) Insertion speed is slowest but retrieval speed is better
    than linkedHashMap but slower than HashMap
Rules:
    1) We can't convert a collection to a map for example we can't convert a set
    to a Map.
    2) Duplicate keys are not allowed in maps
    3) Duplicate values are allowed
Map is an interface which many classes implement.

Map<String,String> students = new Map<>();
students.put("Yaz123","Yazgul");
Set<String> set = new HashSet(students);
