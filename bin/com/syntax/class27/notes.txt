Collections Framework in Java:
Collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in a better way
1) ArraysList
   - This class has many built-in methods like add() remove() clear() etc.
   - Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time
ArrayList<>arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList - name of the class
<> - diamond operator we specify the datatype
why Wrapper classes :
   - we get built-in methods
   - a lot of frameworks don't support primitives
When to use primitives:
    when we care about memory because primitives occupy 4 TIMES LESS MEMORY
    as compared to wrappers.
    when we care about performance
When to use Wrapper :
    when we care about our ease.

Each java primitive has a corresponding wrapper.

In arrayList we don't have to move the data we just adjust the pointers
