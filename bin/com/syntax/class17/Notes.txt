Types of variables:
There are 3 types of variables lokal, instance and static

Class Vars{
int age=10; //instance variable (if they have static in front they are static variable)
static double weight=25.5;  //static variable
void method(){
String name="Moreed";       //local variable

}

}

Local variables:
If a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block
of code it is called a local variable.
Instance variables:
If a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class then
it is called an instance variable.
Static variable:
If a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class, and
it has static keyword with it then.
it is called a static variable.

When to use which type of variable:
Local variable --> should always be preferred over instance and static variables
why because they occupy the computers' memory for very, very short amount of time
as soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them.
Pros:
save memory
cons:
not accessible outside of methods/block of code
Instance Variable --> when we want to share something in multiple methods of
a class and the information is expected to be different from object to object we should
go with the instance variables.
Pros:
accessible in all the methods of a class
Cons:
occupy the computers' memory for longer than local variables.
Static variables:
when we know the information will stay the same for all the objects of a class we should create
a static variable for that
Pros:
single memory location for all objects of a class
Cons:
stay longer in the memory
can hold only one value at a time.
