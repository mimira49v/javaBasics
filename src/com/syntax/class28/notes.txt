Wrapper classes:
    they are object for all the primitive types.When we use the  wrapper classes we get all the
    benefits of classes and objects for example we can have built-in methods.
    generic works with only classes.
Boxing in wrapper classes:
    Boxing happens when we convert a primitive to corresponding wrapper type.
    example:
    int num=10;
    Integer num2=new Integer(num);  //this is called boxing
    Unboxing happens when we convert a wrapper object to a corresponding primitive type.
    INTERVIEW QUESTION!
    Integer num2=new Integer(10)
    int num = num2.intValue();

    Integer num=10;     //autoBoxing
    int num2=num;       //auto unboxing
    List(it is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by two classes
    ArrayList LinkedList)
    1) we can store the duplicate values in lists.
    2) insertion order is maintained.
When to use ArrayList:
    If most of the operations are reading and storing new data and not shifting
    or changing the position of data then we should go with array list.
When to use LinkedList:
    when most of the operations are related to changing the position of data or related to data shifting
    then we should with LinkedList.
