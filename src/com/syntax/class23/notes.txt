Method overloading in Java:
Lets you have same named method in a class but different parameters.
When same method name exists in a class but with a different number of parameters
or different type of parameters or different sequence of parameters.
Advantages of method overloading:
    Flexibility of having same name methods in a class
    End user gets the benefit that he does not need to remember different method names
Rules:
    we can overload the constructors
    we can overload the static method as well
    we can overload the main method as well
    we can overload private methods as well
Rules for static methods:
Static methods can't access instance fields directly
Instance methods can access instance as well static fields directly

Method overriding:

    1) Method overriding happens when we have same named methods in the
    parent class and in the child class, but we need a different output

    2) we have to use the same logic and the same parameters

    3) we can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship
    between two classes

    4) we can't override the private methods because they don't
    participate in inheritance.

    5) we can't override the constructors are not inherited by subclasses

    6) Overriding can be done only with non-static methods.

    7) Access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method access level
       in inheritance be more restrictive than the overridden method access level
       so if you put public in a parent class we won't be able to declare private later

interview question
To override same types of parameters *
To overload different types of parameters *

A method declared final cannot be overridden
A subclass in a different package can only override the non-final methods declared public or protected.
