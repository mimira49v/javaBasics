Constructors in java:
Same as method but named as class, not allowed any return type.
Constructors in java are special blocks of code similar to methods that initialize
object of the class.
Rules:
 1) no return types not even void.
 2) name of the constructor must be same as name of the class.
 3) constructors can't have non access modifiers like static final etc.
 4) we can use the access modifiers like public private protected with constructors.
 5) if we don't write a constructor in a class default constructor is provided by compiler.
 Main responsibility of compiler is to reverse code to binary code and checks your code.
 6) we can have multiple constructors in a class but their number of arguments sequence of  argument or
 type of arguments should be different.
 7) if we have multiple constructors then Java decide which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass.
This keyword:
it is a reserved keyword in java that we can use to refer to instance variables methods or
constructor of a class
1) "this" keyword is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables.
2) we can use "this" keyword to call the constructor of a class inside another constructor.
3) we can use the "this" keyword to call the methods of a class.
Rules about this keyword:
1) this() should be the first line inside a constructor.
1) this() can't be used inside methods.
