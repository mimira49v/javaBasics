Access modifiers in Java:
Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class
members in java(fields, methods, constructors etc. ) and classes itself in Java.
There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we use to define these levels.
Fourth level is applied when we don't use any access modifier keyword.
Levels from most restricted to less restricted are:

1)private(keyword is also private)
2)default (no keyword means default access level)
3)protected (keyword is also protected)
4)public (keyword is also public)
Rules:

1) We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields.Because fields contain
the data and the methods of your class might use that data to perform some tasks if
we don't perform sanity checks before setting the values to these fields our classes and methods
might misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that everyone can't access
the data.
2) We can't use access modifiers with local variables.
=====================================================
Constructors in java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class.
Contractor shouldn't be static cuz we have to pass different objects every time
in a static variable we can store only one variable.

(instance means different variable for same object)
