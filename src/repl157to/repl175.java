**Follow Steps Carefully.
Step1: Create Interface as FirstInterface and create undefined method as firstMethod (without parameter)
Step 2: Create another interface as SecondInterface in which create a method as secondMethod (Without Parameter)
Step 3: Inherit both interfaces to Main class.
Step 4: Execute both methods
Expected Output:
First Method implementing multiple Inheritance
Second Method implementing multiple Inheritance
